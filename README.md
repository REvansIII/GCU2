As of 09oct2016 the Vending Machine Project now has two abstract classes and subclasses to form an inheritance hierarchy.  The project now displays a list of snacks and their respective price.  Running of the project in the Eclipse IDE was done by selecting the run icon.

As of 16oct2016 the Vending Machine Project implements the Comparable interface via the Drink and Snack classes.  Tests in the main method outputs the index difference between two compared (compareTo method) Product objects.  

As of 23oct2016 the project includes a JavaFX user interface and preliminary Transaction Handling Class.  With regard to the GUI, while the buttons are functional there is room for improved functionality as event handling is not covered until topic 5.  Screenshots are included with this upload.
